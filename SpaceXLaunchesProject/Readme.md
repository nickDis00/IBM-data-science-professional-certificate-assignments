In this project, the objective is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars, while other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars per launch. Much of the savings come from SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. Therefore, by predicting whether the first stage will land successfully, we can estimate the overall cost of a launch.
